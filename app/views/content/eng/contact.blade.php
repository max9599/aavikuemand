                            <p>Directions for driving: We reside on the 40th kilometer of the Tallinn-Paldiski road. There is a large wooden bulletin board for Kersalu village and some mailboxes 50m after the sign towards Madise (Do not drive to Madise). Alongside those is a small gravel road. Drive along that for 300m, until there is a large green container. Pass that, and you have made it.</p>
                            <p>Please do not use GPS systems based on the Regio map, as it sends you to a road, that has not existed for 50 years.</p>
