                    <p>More than one hundred old lime trees are surrounding our garden on the rocks. They are planted by Mother Nature. Owners started gardening only at 2006, but during these years there are planted more than 250 sorts of roses, more than 50 sorts of peonies and collection of siberian irises to enjoy in June, good collection of daylilies and lilies for July, good collection of Echinacheas and hydrangeas to enjoy late summer. More than one thousand taxons of perennials, bushes and trees and some of them are really rare in Estonia.</p>
