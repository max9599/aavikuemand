                    <p>Our garden is the place, what is very old from one side and very young from other side. The history of this place has started probably 14 thousands years ago, when melting of the last Ice age has carried hundreds of huge stones and made a small hill near the seashore. It is not known, when first people moved here, but the village itself was mentioned on 12th century. On 1940-s there have been archaeological excavations, during them have been explored family grave from the beginning of 18th century, during the Northern War between Sweden and Russia. In this time it has been also the big epidemic, when 80% of population died into plague and often buried near home. So probably this place has been populated already more than 300 years ago.</p>
                    <p>The first written remarks are from 1879, when Awiko was registered as an unit in the land register. Two years later, June 11th on 1881, the land has been sold to the fisherman Jürri Lemming for the 300 silver roubles, what has been to be paid in 20 years. Jürri was my grand-grandmothers uncle and has no children himself. So after his passing away in 1920-s the place went to my grand-grandmother and belonged to our family more than 130 years. During the First World War there have been guarding lines, but for luck no battles. During the soviet time after the Second World War the land was confiscated and only 1400 m2 left to the family. Everything started to bush and wild, because the care of the woodland was forbidden, but the same time soviet farms did not anything, because the place was not attractive for farming.</p>
                    <p>My grandmother has lived in here until the 1995, when she died. We started to renovate in here from 1997 and started from removing the bush around the house. There was dark, wild and bushy and the house was broken.
                    During the house renovation 1997-2005 there was no garden at all, because house renovation took all our time and money. Also the building and gardening do not fit J.
                    When the house has been at last more or less ready, I have looked around and decided to plant some roses and conifers. I have been very sure, that gardening is not for me, and I had not any interest for weeding. I have been busy at work and with other hobbies and had a few time for garden and home.</p>
                    <p>On 2006 I got first diagnosis of cancer and suddenly after the surgery I had a plenty of time to look around. And more and less I felt, that I need a beauty around and so I started my first garden.
                    Just later I learned that gardening is a therapy. Any therapy does not replace the medicine, but it is helping a lot. I had several surgeries during 2006-2009, but after this all analyses have been clean and my garden helps me all the time.
                    It is a woodland garden, founded for relaxing and therapy. We do not worry about every weed and do not think, what the neighbours mean about. It is a place to walk, see, feel, smell and taste. Nevertheless, weeding and cutting the old flowers after stressing day in the town is also the therapy.</p>
                    <p>The garden is in change all the time, because making something new makes me happy. And happy people are healthy and live longer.</p>
                    <p>In summer 2012 I mentioned, that this garden is helping not only me, but also the guests. People can relax in here just in 10 minutes. The stress is leaving. Guests, who are staying overnight, sleep twelve hours. So I decided to open the garden to the guests. If just half and hour in the garden can help somebody, it can be a great thing for this person.
